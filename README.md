# Lab 19: ToDo API

Practice making an API with ASP.NET Core and C#. Starting from an empty API template, write out the CRUD operations for ToDos and ToDoLists. ToDos can only belong to one ToDoList, and ToDoLists can have many ToDos.

## API Endpoints

* api/todos
* api/todos/{id}
* api/todolists
* api/todolists/{id}
